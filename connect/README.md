# What is Posit Connect?

Posit Connect connects you and the work you do with others as never before. Only Posit Connect provides:

* "One button" deployment into a single environment for Shiny applications, R Markdown documents, Plumber APIs, 
  Python Jupyter notebooks, Quarto documents and projects, or any static R plot or graph.
* Extended deployment capabilities supporting Python APIs and applications using Shiny, Flask, Dash, FastAPI, Bokeh, 
  and Streamlit, as well as automated deployments for any content type via Git or command-line scripts.

# How to use this image

Below is a very simple example for running Connect locally in Docker using a product license key.
```bash
# Replace with valid license
export RSC_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

# Run without persistent data and using default configuration
docker run -it --privileged \
    -p 3939:3939 \
    -e RSC_LICENSE=$RSC_LICENSE \
    rstudio/rstudio-connect:ubuntu2204
```
Once running, open [http://localhost:3939](http://localhost:3939) to access Posit Connect.

## Overview

This Docker container is built following
the [Posit Connect admin guide](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/index.html), please
see [Server Guide/Docker](https://docs.posit.co/connect/admin/server-management/#docker) for more details on the
requirements and how to extend this image.

This container includes:

1. Two versions of R
2. Two versions of Python
3. Quarto
4. Posit Professional Drivers
5. Posit Connect

Note that running the Posit Connect Docker image requires the container to run using the `--privileged` flag and a
valid Posit Connect license.

> IMPORTANT: to use Posit Connect with more than one user, you will need to
> define `Server.Address` in the `rstudio-connect.gcfg` file. To do so, update
> your configuration file with the URL that users will use to visit Connect.
> Then start or restart the container.

## Configuration

The configuration of Posit Connect is made on the `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg` file, mount this file as
volume with an external file on the host machine to change the configuration and restart the container for changes to
take effect.

Be sure the config file has these fields:

- `Server.Address` set to the exact URL that users will use to visit Connect. A
  placeholder `http://localhost:3939` is in use by default
- `Server.DataDir` set to `/data/`
- `HTTP.Listen` (or equivalent `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, or `HTTPRedirect` settings. This could change how you should configure 
  the container ports)
- `Python.Enabled` and `Python.Executable`

See a complete example of that file at `connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`.

### Persistent Data

In order to persist Connect metadata and app data between container restarts configure the Connect `Server.DataDir` 
option to go to a persistent volume. 

The included configuration file expects a persistent volume from the host machine or your docker orchestration system to
be available at `/data`. Should you wish to move this to a different path, you can change the `Server.DataDir` option.

Below is an example of running the Posit Connect container with a bind mount attached to the `/data` directory.

```bash
docker run -it --privileged \
    -p 3939:3939 \
    -e RSC_LICENSE=$RSC_LICENSE \
    --mount type=bind,src=/path/to/local/directory,dst=/data \
    rstudio/rstudio-connect:ubuntu2204
```

### Product Licensing

Using the Posit Connect docker image requires to have a valid License. You can set the license three different ways:

1. Setting the `RSC_LICENSE` environment variable to a valid license key inside the container
2. Setting the `RSC_LICENSE_SERVER` environment variable to a valid license server / port inside the container
3. Mounting a `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/*.lic` single file that contains a valid license for Posit Connect

**NOTE:** Offline installations will need to use a floating license server, license file, or custom image with manual 
intervention to successfully activate the instance.

#### Example usage with a license file

The container will automatically look for a license file at `/var/lib/rstudio-connect/*.lic` and will attempt to use it
for activation if present. This example uses a bind mount to provide the license file from the host machine.

```bash
docker run -it --privileged \
    -p 3939:3939 \
    --mount type=bind,ro,src=<path to license file>,dst=/var/lib/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.lic \
    rstudio/rstudio-connect:ubuntu2204
```

Alternatively, the license file's path in the container can be provided using the `RSC_LICENSE_FILE_PATH` environment 
variable. If provided, the container will attempt to find and activate from the file at the given path.

```bash
docker run -it --privileged \
    -p 3939:3939 \
    -e RSC_LICENSE_FILE_PATH=/opt/license.lic \
    --mount type=bind,ro,src=<path to license file>,dst=/opt/license.lic \
    rstudio/rstudio-connect:ubuntu2204
```

If the license file does not successfully activate, the container should fail to start under most circumstances. You can
still verify the container's licensing status by running the `status` command against the `license-manager` binary.

```bash
$ docker exec -it <container name> /opt/rstudio-connect/bin/license-manager status
TTY detected. Printing informational message about logging configuration. Logging configuration loaded from '/etc/rstudio/logging.conf'. Logging to '/var/log/rstudio/rstudio-server/license-manager.log'.

#### Example usage with a license key

The container can also be activated using a license key by setting the `RSC_LICENSE` environment variable. 

```bash
# Replace with valid license
export RSC_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

# Run without persistent data and using an external configuration
docker run -it --privileged \
    -p 3939:3939 \
    -e RSC_LICENSE=$RSC_LICENSE \
    rstudio/rstudio-connect:ubuntu2204
```

If possible, license key activation should be avoided in production environments in favor of using a license file due to 
the risk of leaking license activations when the container is not gracefully stopped. See the 
[caveats of product licensing in containers](#caveats-of-product-licensing-in-containers) section below for more 
details on license key issues.

## Caveats of product licensing in containers

*Note: This section **does not** apply to activations using license files.*

There is currently a known licensing bug when using our products in containers. If the container is not stopped
gracefully, the license deactivation step may fail or be skipped. Failing to deactivate the license can result in a 
"license leak" where a product activation is used up and cannot be deactivated using traditional methods as the 
activation state on the container has been lost.

To avoid "leaking" licenses, we encourage users not to force kill containers and to use `--stop-timeout 120` and 
`--time 120` for `docker run` and `docker stop` commands respectively. This helps ensure the deactivation script has 
ample time to run properly.

In some situations, it can be difficult or impossible to avoid a hard termination (e.g. power failure, 
critical error on host). Unfortunately, any of these cases can still cause a license to leak an activation. To help
prevent a license leak in these situations, users can mount the following directories to persistent storage to preserve
the license state data across restarts of the container. **These directories differ between products.**

* License Key
  * `/var/lib/.local`
  * `/var/lib/.prof`
  * `/var/lib/rstudio-connect`
* Floating License
  * `/var/lib/.TurboFloat`

Please note that the files created in these directories are hardware locked and non-transferable between hosts. Due to
the nature of the hardware fingerprinting algorithm, any low-level changes to the host or container can cause existing
license state files to invalidate. To avoid this problem, we advise that product containers are gracefully shutdown
and allowed to deactivate prior to changing any hardware or firmware on the host (e.g. upgrading a network card or 
updating BIOS) or the container (e.g. changing the network driver used or the allocated number of CPU cores).

While preserving license state data *can* help avoid license leaks across restarts, it's not a guarantee. If you run
into issues with your license, please do not hesitate to [contact Posit support](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us).

While neither of these solutions will eliminate the problem, they should help mitigate it. We are still investigating a 
long-term solution.
