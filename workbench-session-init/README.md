# Posit Workbench Session Init Container

This init container can be used to pull the session runtime components into another base session image, which can then 
be used to run Workbench sessions. This image is intended to be used in conjunction with the 
[Posit Workbench Session](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/workbench-session) and 
[Posit Workbench](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/rstudio-workbench) images.
