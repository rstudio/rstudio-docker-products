# Posit Workbench Session Init Container

This directory contains a Dockerfile and script that will create an init container to copy session runtime components from a release package into a target mount directory. This init container can be used to pull the session runtime components into another base sesssion image, which can then be used to run Workbench sessions.

## Building

Just will build an image using a default Connect distribution.

```console
just build
```

Daily builds are also supported. To build the daily image, run:

```console
just preview-bake workbench-session-init-daily
```

## Testing

You can observe what gets copied by the container:

```console
mkdir init
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/init:/mnt/init rstudio/workbench-session-init:jammy-2025.05.1
# The init directory has been populated with the Workbench session runtime components.
```

You can also test using GOSS:

```console
just test workbench-session-init
```
