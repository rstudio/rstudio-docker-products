# What are the Workbench Session images?

Images for R and Python sessions and jobs to be used RStudio Workbench, Launcher, and Kubernetes.

# Notice for support 

1. This image may introduce **BREAKING** changes; as such we recommend:
   - Avoid using the `{operating-system}` tags to avoid unexpected version changes, and
   - Always read through the [NEWS](./NEWS.md) to understand the changes before updating.
1. Outdated images will be removed periodically from DockerHub as product version updates are made. Please make plans to
   update at times or use your own build of the images.
1. These images are meant as a starting point for your needs. Consider creating a fork of this repo, where you can
   continue to merge in changes we make while having your own security scanning, base OS in use, or other custom
   changes. We
   provide [instructions for how to build and use](#how-to-use-these-docker-images)
   for these cases.
1. **Security Note:** These images are provided AS IS based on the build environment at the time their product version 
   was released/updated. They should be reviewed and updated before production use. If your organization has a specific 
   set of security requirements related to CVE/Vulnerability severity levels, you should plan to use the 
   [instructions for building](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-docker-products#instructions-for-building) to clone this repository, and rebuild these images to your specific internal 
   security standards.

# How to use these images

The Docker images built from these Dockerfiles are intended to be used for R and
Jupyter sessions and jobs with Posit Workbench (PWB), Launcher, and
Kubernetes.

Note: These Docker images are not equipped or intended to be used to run Posit
Workbench within a Docker container. Visit the
[rstudio/rstudio-worbench Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/rstudio-workbench)
for images built for that purpose.

Note: These images do not include the Posit Workbench Session Components. To use these images with Posit Workbench, the 
[session init container](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/workbench-session-init) must be enabled within the Posit 
Workbench configuration. For more information, refer to the 
[Posit Workbench documentation](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/admin/job_launcher/using_docker_images.html).

For more information about Posit Workbench and Launcher, refer to the
[Launcher Overview](https://docs.posit.co/ide/server-pro/admin/job_launcher/job_launcher.html) in the
Posit Workbench documentation.

For more information about how to use these images with Posit Workbench and
Launcher, refer to the support article on [Using Docker images with
Posit Workbench, Launcher, and Kubernetes](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/360019253393-Using-Docker-images-with-Posit-Workbench-Launcher-and-Kubernetes).

We provide simple ways to extend and build the Dockerfiles. After you have cloned the repo, you can create your own 
containers fairly simply with the provided Justfile in the repository.

## Overview

Built images are available from the [rstudio/workbench-session](https://hub.docker.com/r/rstudio/workbench-session)
repository on Docker Hub.

These images include the following layers:

* Base OS
* System packages required for R, R packages, and RStudio Professional Drivers
* Two versions of R
* Two versions of Python
* Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, and RSW/RSC notebook extensions
* RStudio Professional Drivers
