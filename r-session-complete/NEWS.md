# 2025-07-03

- Update README.md links.

# 2025.03.11

- Quarto TinyTeX installation path has been updated from `/root/.TinyTeX` to `/opt/.TinyTeX` to fix potential permission 
  issues when called from a non-root user. As a result, Quarto will no longer recognize TinyTeX as a managed 
  installation. This change is not expected to affect the existing functionality of Quarto or TinyTeX for end users.
  TinyTeX's relevant packages will still be linked to `/usr/local/bin` as before.

# 2023.03.1
- Update Python VSCode extension to version 2023.6.1

# 2023.03.0

# 2022.12.0

- Upgrade workbench to 2022.12.0
- Use the new `WORKBENCH_JUPYTER_PATH` env var to configure jupyter location
- Remove `vscode.conf/exe` configuration in favor of the new, internal default `code-server` installation
- Refactor image to build _FROM_ the new `product-base-pro` image

# 2022.07.0

- Add a `/usr/local/bin/jupyter` symlink
- Configure Workbench to preinstall R, Python, and Quarto extensions for users on session startup
- Add workbench_jupyterlab python package for the jupyterlab extension

# 2021.09.0

- **BREAKING**: Rename `RSP_` variables to `RSW_`. Rename RStudio Server Pro to RStudio Workbench
- **BREAKING**: Change `R_VERSION` to 4.1.0
- **BREAKING**: Change `PYTHON_VERSION` to 3.9.5
- **BREAKING**: R and Python packages are no longer installed by default in session images.

We have removed R and Python packages from the session image.  This should:
- reduce the image build time and size
- make it easier for data scientists to develop reproducible environments
- eliminate conflicts between system libraries and subsequent user updates

If the removal of these system libraries introduces some problems for you, please file an issue.
